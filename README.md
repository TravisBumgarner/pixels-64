3D models, PCB diagram and schematic, and code for controlling a two dimensional array of 64 individually addressable RGB LEDs. 

## Choose your own journey

### Follow Along

This repository offers a starting point for a project that uses a 8x8 grid of 64 individually addressable RGB LEDs. This includes CAD files for both 3D printing and PCB manufacturing, as well as the code to control the LEDs.

### Build your own

The PCB is designed so that it can be combined in any combination of N by M boards.
