### V1.0 Initial Case Design

The parts were printed on printer with a max printing area of 220mm x 220mm. 

1. Print `base-plate.stl` and `walls.stl` in black. 
2. Print `case.stl` in white. 
    - Note - The case services as the "screen" of the pixel64. It can be challenging to get a clean print of such a size. You'll need very good first layer adhesion. An alternative here would be to make a case out of white acrylic instead or cover the walls with a white sheet of paper.
