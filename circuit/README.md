The board is designed as a 4x4 array of WS2812B LEDs. Each board can be combined in an N by M orientation. Feel free to order your own boards and make larger displays. 

Each version has two folders inside. 
- `kicad` contains the KiCad project files.
- `jlcpcb` contains the files sent to JLCPCB for order.
